# Order Book Application

This is a Flask application designed to replace the functionality of a service like iContacts for businesses. Currently, the application only has the basic skeleton in place, but in the future, a database will be connected to address the issue of iContacts being slow.

## Getting Started

To run this application in your favorite IDE, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Start the Flask application by running the command `python app.py` or `flask run`.
4. The application should now be running on your localhost at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Future Plans

As mentioned earlier, this application is still in its early stages and only has the basic skeleton in place. In the future, a database will be connected to the application to provide more robust functionality. Stay tuned for updates.
